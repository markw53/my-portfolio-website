// I began my career in software development in the late 1990s to early 2000s as an analyst programmer, working on bespoke business ERP systems. While my career took a different path after that, my passion for creating software remained strong, and it was always my dream to return to it.
// I started building websites as a hobby and volunteered for various projects. During a job in a school office, I developed an interest in Python and saw its potential for automation. Since then, I've been on a mission to learn as much as I can, building my skills and knowledge through courses like Code First Girls. More recently, completing a JavaScript bootcamp with Northcoders has really deepened my expertise and expanded my understanding. 
// Working on projects—whether solo or collaboratively—truly allows me to feel like my authentic self and brings me happiness. The combination of creativity and problem-solving gives me real satisfaction, especially when I can create something that provides a meaningful solution and positively impacts people's lives.
